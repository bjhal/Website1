    </h1>
    <h3>
        Like many other first-edition cards from the 1990s, this Venusuar is one of the rarest and most valuable cards out there today. Ones that fit the criteria for the tens of thousands of dollars are marked by their lack of a rarity stamp, which was only introduced in later reprints and editions. There are a handful of such cards out there, but only five have been graded a 10 by PSA – meaning they’re in perfect condition.<br>
