        It’s Magikarp! And yep, you guessed it, the value is attributed to how absurdly rare this one is. This card was only given out as a reward for winning a battle during the Tamamushi University Hyper Test. You need to have some incredibly strong connections or deep pockets to add this to your collection.<br>
