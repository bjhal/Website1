        2000 Pokemon Neo Genesis 1st Edition Holo Lugia

    </h1>
    <h3>
        Everyone loves Lugia, so it's no surprise that this card is on the pricey side. Cards from this particular Neo Genesis set have been classed as very hard to grade due to a number of printing errors during their early runs. Only about 40 of these cards have ever been graded.<br>
        <h2>144,300$</h2>
