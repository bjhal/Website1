        This sweet card is a rare example of a Dark-type Charizard, and the art depicts the shiny version of everyone’s favorite creature. This card was printed as part of the Dragon Frontiers set in 2006, and currently, there are only 59 at Grade 10 around today, making them quite high-value at auctions.<br>
