        This is a card that was given away to top-performing players in the competitive TCG scene. The Pokémon Players Club used to use an XP system for its rankings, and if you were able to earn 70k XP during their fourth season, you’d be given this card as a reward. The highest PSA grade one of these has ever received is a 9.5, making it extremely rare to find one in top condition.
